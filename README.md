# CyborgSecurity

**CyborgSecurity** is a full-stack, simulated cybersecurity suite for human-machine interfaces (HMI), designed to protect next-generation cyborg implants such as neural links, pacemakers, and electronic prosthetics. This Python-based application combines real-time threat detection, encrypted alerting, and a futuristic web console to simulate the security challenges of a cybernetic future.

From spoofed biosignals to memory tampering, CyborgSecurity models real-world attack vectors and provides a secure, interactive platform for education, research, and innovation in implant security.

## What It Does

- Monitors neural biosignals for **spoofing, drift, and replay attacks**  
- Validates data packet integrity using **SHA-256 checksums**  
- Detects **system clock tampering** and **memory integrity violations**  
- Calculates dynamic **threat severity scores** for triage  
- Logs alerts to **encrypted JSON, CSV, and plaintext logs**  
- Serves a **real-time, interactive Flask dashboard** with filtering and export  
- Simulates a **live Threat Intelligence Feed** with dynamic attack injection  
- Provides a **comprehensive educational hub** on neural and medical implants  
- Supports **contact and feedback** via integrated email form  
- All secure pages protected with **authentication (admin/cyborg123)**

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youngsassanid/cyborgsecurity.git
cd cyborgsecurity
```

### 2. Set Up the Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install flask cryptography
```

> No `requirements.txt`? Just install the two core dependencies.

### 3. Run the Program

```bash
python cyborgsecurity.py
```

You can optionally pass arguments:
```bash
python cyborgsecurity.py --debug      # Enable debug mode
python cyborgsecurity.py --no-debug   # Disable debug mode
python cyborgsecurity.py test         # Run unit tests
```

## Access the Web Console

Once running, open your browser and visit:

| Page | URL | Login Required |
|------|-----|----------------|
| **Home** | `http://localhost:5000` | No |
| **Dashboard** | `http://localhost:5000/dashboard` | Yes (`admin` / `cyborg123`) |
| **Threat Intel** | `http://localhost:5000/threat-intel` | Yes |
| **Pricing** | `http://localhost:5000/pricing` | Yes |
| **Resources** | `http://localhost:5000/resources` | Yes |
| **Contact** | `http://localhost:5000/contact` | Yes |

## Output Files

- `cyborgsecurity.log` ‚Äì System events and errors
- `alerts.json` ‚Äì Decrypted alert data (for analysis)
- `alerts.csv` ‚Äì Tabular log of all alerts
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` ‚Äì *Not stored* (ephemeral key generated at runtime)

> **Note:** This is a simulation prototype. Not for production use.

---

## Debug Mode & Testing

Use command-line arguments to control behavior:

```bash
python cyborgsecurity.py --debug    # Enable verbose logging
python cyborgsecurity.py test       # Run unit tests
```

Or follow the interactive prompt to toggle debug mode.

## üß† Implant Simulation

The system simulates a **NeuroLink V3** implant, but you can extend the `CyborgInterface` class to model:

- Neuralink-style BCIs
- Pacemakers and ICDs
- Smart cochlear implants
- Retinal chips
- Electronic prosthetics

Perfect for research, education, and exploring the future of cyber-physical security.
