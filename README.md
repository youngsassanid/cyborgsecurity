# CyborgSecurity

**CyborgSecurity** is a full-stack, simulated cybersecurity suite for human-machine interfaces (HMI), designed to protect next-generation cyborg implants such as neural links, pacemakers, and electronic prosthetics. This Python-based application combines real-time threat detection, encrypted alerting, and a futuristic web console to simulate the security challenges of a cybernetic future.

From spoofed biosignals to memory tampering, CyborgSecurity models real-world attack vectors and provides a secure, interactive platform for education, research, and innovation in implant security.

## What It Does

- Monitors neural biosignals for **spoofing, drift, and replay attacks**  
- Validates data packet integrity using **SHA-256 checksums**  
- Detects **system clock tampering** and **memory integrity violations**  
- Calculates dynamic **threat severity scores** for triage  
- Logs alerts to **encrypted JSON, CSV, and plaintext logs**  
- Serves a **real-time, interactive Flask dashboard** with filtering and export  
- Simulates a **live Threat Intelligence Feed** with dynamic attack injection  
- Provides a **comprehensive educational hub** on neural and medical implants  
- Supports **contact and feedback** via integrated email form  
- All secure pages protected with **authentication (admin/cyborg123)**  
- Activates **GOAT Mode** — zero-trust emergency lockdown for critical threats  
- Monitors **biomedical health metrics** in real time via the Health Monitor

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youngsassanid/cyborgsecurity.git
cd cyborgsecurity
```

### 2. Set Up the Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install flask cryptography
```

> No `requirements.txt`? Just install the two core dependencies.

### 3. Run the Program

```bash
python cyborgsecurity.py
```

You can optionally pass arguments:
```bash
python cyborgsecurity.py --debug      # Enable debug mode
python cyborgsecurity.py --no-debug   # Disable debug mode
python cyborgsecurity.py test         # Run unit tests
```
